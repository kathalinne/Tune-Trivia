# Tune Trivia

Description
In Tune Trivia, two players will have the opportunity to compete to see who recognizes the most songs and how quickly they can guess the songs. A tone to a random popular song will play and whichever player presses the button first, will have a chance to guess the title of the song based on three options given to them. If the chosen answer is incorrect, the second player is next to guess and now has a 50/50 chance to get the points. Points awarded are based on the time the button was pressed by the first player for each individual song. Goal is to accumulate the most points by guessing the title of the song correctly and fast.
